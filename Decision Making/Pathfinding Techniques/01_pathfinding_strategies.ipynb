    "- **Optimality**: BFS is optimal when all moves have the same cost, as it explores nodes level by level. DFS, on the other hand, is not guaranteed to find the shortest path.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: BFS has a higher space complexity than DFS due to the need to store all nodes at the current level. This can be a limiting factor in memory-constrained environments.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: In the worst-case scenario, both DFS and BFS have a time complexity of `O(b^d)`, where `b` is the branching factor (the average number of children per node) and `d` is the depth of the solution. However, the actual time taken can vary based on the structure of the graph and the specific path taken.\n",

The agent's goal is to find the path with the lowest total cost from the start to the goal. This added cost factor is important in real-world scenarios where different paths may have different costs associated with them (e.g., for determining the fastest route on a road network).\n",
    "\n",
    "This additional cost factor introduces a new dimension to pathfinding, as the agent must now consider both the distance to the goal and the cost of moving through each tile. This will allow more sophisticated algorithms to find the optimal path based on the total cost rather than just the number of moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will assign a cost of `1` to empty tiles except for a rectangular region defined by the coordinates `(L // 3, 0)` and `(2L // 3, H - 1)`, where the cost is a constant `c > 1`. This region represents a \"difficult terrain\" that the agent should avoid if possible."
